        <p>
            Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other 
            protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of 
            time in a boxing ring.

            A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, 
            disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent. When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.
